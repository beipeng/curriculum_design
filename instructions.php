		<h2>Experiment Instructions</h2>
		<p>In this study, your goal is to design a curriculum (a set of assignments) for a virtual dog to train on, so that the dog can quickly complete the target assignment.</p>

		<p>A library of assignments will be provided in a 4x4 grid world. You can select any assignment in any order to design your curriculum. 
		But the quality of your designed curriculum directly affects the dog's performance in the target assignment.</p>

		<p>You will be paid as long as you complete the study, but you will be paid an additional compensation which is commensurate with the quality of your designed curriculum. 
		The better curriculum you design for the dog, the more additional money you get paid.</p> 

		<p>Before beginning, we will walk you through the interface for designing the curriculum for the dog.</p>
